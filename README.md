Agriculture plays a crucial role in Indiaâ€™s socio-economic development. This project aims to introduce a Machine Learning-powered recommendation system to aid farmers in selecting suitable crops and fertilizers for their land. The system relies on soil composition, including Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorous levels, along with factors like temperature, humidity, moisture, and soil type, which influence crop suitability. Recommending appropriate fertilizers tailored to specific crops can optimize fertilizer usage, leading to improved crop health, yield, and reduced environmental impact. Machine learning holds immense potential in yield analysis, providing accurate predictions crucial for agricultural planning. This system employs various Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machine to predict crop yield using historical data, while also recommending appropriate fertilizers for specific crops. The objective is to develop a prediction model capable of forecasting future crop yields, facilitating informed decision-making for farmers.
